                        My name is <strong>Fabian Sugandhi</strong>, an eager and driven web developer 
                        based in Sydney, Australia. Coming from a Civil Engineering background, 
                        I have previously worked in the construction industry in both Estimating and Project Management side.

                        In 2024, having learned and experienced many aspects within the field of construction 
                        and contracting, it finally dawned on me that it was time to push myself to a 
                        new career direction, to finally venture somewhere I'm always passionate about. 
                        Armed with enthusiasm and determination, I decided to start my voyage into the IT industry 
                        as a web developer. And that journey started with my enrolment in Coder Academy.

                        In my current studies at Coder Academy, I am learning and expanding
                        my arsenal of IT skills. I am currently learning and will be proficient
                        with the following:

                        During my breaks and free time, especially when it's a "me time", I always found myself 
                        filling them with movies, comic books, video games, and music. In fact, I quite often lose 
                        track of time getting engaged in the well-crafted magic not seldomly found in several of 
                        these art forms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From when I was a child, I also truly enjoy learning new things and discovering the inner 
                        mechanisms behind them, how the smaller pieces work together to create a marvel of creation. 
                        Fast forward to today, this evergrowing curiosity finally kickstarted my journey into programming 
                        and development, a career which beautifully integrates art, discovery and engineering, the magical 
                        ocean which I am very eager to finally dive deep into.
