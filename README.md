## Purpose

The purpose of this portofolio website is to represent me as a developer and IT professional. The website provides viewers with information regarding my background, skill, interests, and experience. It is essentially an interactive and expansive form of my resume, able to communicate and demonstrate more about my abilities to prospective clients and collaborators than the usually much more compact resume.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the website are employers looking to engage a developer and/or IT professional. They are expected to have industrial knowledge and expectations, including but not limited to: technical knowledge relating to IT, software development, programming languages, and development stacks. Additionally, as professional themselves, they will also have high expectations of professionalism and work ethic.

## Functionality/Features

The website is designed with the core principles of simplicity, boldness, and engagement. The multiple components of the website are engineered to be easily distinguishable for the viewers, while still keeping the main function of communicating the myriad of information explained in the "Purpose" section above. This is achieved through the manipulation of the website hierarchy and content, such as the headings, sections, typography, and colours.

While there are a lot of content that I would like to showcase, it is also very important to avoid overloading viewers with information, hence the consideration for this design concept that I decided on, which I will explain below.

First, the colour scheme. I have chosen a dark background colour (Dark Grey for the "body" and Grey for the "navigation bar") complemented with contrasting-coloured fonts (Green and White, depending on the hierarchy) as headings to make them stand out, allowing the to viewers to easily skim through to find their desired content.\
For the parapraphs and informative texts, I have chosen a colour (Grey) darker than the headers to further highlight the difference in content hierachy; this colour, not standing out as prominently from the background, will draw a little bit more of the viewers' focus to read, which they will already have after skimming between headings and deciding to see the content.\
This color scheme creates a dynamic engagement of attention, akin to the visual file system of the general computer OS, without actually having any folders present.
